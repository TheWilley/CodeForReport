Remove all code styling and auto remove indent, then copy it.

Rich editors likes to take the style (such as background and colors) of the code when copied and pasted from Visual Studio Code or simular programs. This is not ideal, and thus this applicatioon removes those attributes. Further more, if code copied is indented, it is also auto removed when copied.
